# twilio-sms-reminders

  This is a SMS reminder service using Python and Twilio.

## Approach Taken

  I've been trying to get my foot in the door to any tech company that will take me so I'm applying to the Twilio Software Engineer Apprentice program.  I didn't know a lot about Twilio, so after researching their site, it's pretty awesome!  You can do so much and I can see how much fun it would be working there and helping companies find some competitive advantages.  Part of the application process is submitting a video of a current project and if we have a Twilio app, we should link it too.  Well, I have to do all I can to get a chance right?  


## Technologies Used

  •	Python
  •	Flask
  •	Twilio API
  •	PythonAnywhere 
  

## Problems/Things to work on

  • The link is only going to show JSON right now.  I will work on incorporating a front-end framework soon.  It will be here soon. [theZues.pythonanywhere.com](https://theZues.pythonanywhere.com)
  • I'm in the middle of learning Python, but I never got lost in what the code meant.  Thanks GA!

  •	There's no database, but I will probably use PostgreSQL and/or MongoDB.
